# coffee-competition

Living in Yew Tee, Starbucks has been super inaccessible. That's why when I saw that Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (CBTL) was going to open at Yew Tee Point, I thought about the possibility that a Starbucks might open there soon.

I discussed with a friend about how CBTL and Starbucks locations often open very near each other (or just beside each other in same cases) because of their fierce competition, but then wondered "to what extent?"

So I built a Python script that scraped the coordinates of all the locations from both CBTL and Starbucks' websites, and churned through the data. The list shows the nearest Starbucks location for every CBTL location in Singapore. What I found was that the average distance between each CBTL location and its nearest Starbucks is just 320 metres, with the furthest one being about 2km apart between Airport T4 and Plaza 8 (a building in Changi Business Park).

I also slot in the upcoming Yew Tee Point CBTL location to make a comparison to all the other distances, and it ranked #4 on the list, behind generally inaccessible places like Serangoon Gardens and Bukit Timah.

Although Starbucks has a little over 2x the number of outlets as CBTL (130 vs 59), this has me a little optimistic that they might open a location to compete here in Yew Tee.

Thanks for taking the time to read my super random rant/analysis, now let me get back to trying to collect stars to maintain my Starbucks gold for another year.
